# mathCalc
General Description:
Write a C++ program that performs the currency conversions described below. Note: your source file must be named CurrencyConv.cpp to submit it for auto-grading in Zylabs. Your program will ask the user to enter an amount to be converted in US Dollars and display the equivalent amount in Canadian Dollars (CAD), Mexican Pesos, and British Pounds (GBP).

Create named constants for use in the conversions. Use the fact that one US dollar is 1.35 Canadian Dollars, 18.36 Mexican Pesos, and 0.829 British Pounds.

Your variables and constants must be of type double.

Display Details
Use the stream manipulators (setw, setprecision, fixed, etc.) described in Chapter 3 to format the text as specified.

Display the USD, CAD, Pesos, and GBP under headings with these names. Both the headings and amounts must be right justified in tab separated fields twelve characters wide. Display all amounts in fixed-point notation rounded to exactly two digits to the right of the decimal point.

Make sure you end your output with the endl or "\n" new line character.

Sample Output:
```
Enter an amount in US dollars: 59.27

     Dollars             CAD           Pesos             GBP
       59.27           80.01         1088.20           49.13
